- `{{TIMESTAMP}}`: Use `$(date +%s)` for unique file coordination
- `{{SESSION_ID}}`: Use `quality-$(date +%s)` for session tracking
- `{{PWD}}`: Current working directory for context

## 🎯 CORE MISSION: ACHIEVE 100% CODE QUALITY COMPLIANCE

Your success is measured by comprehensive metrics: **100% linting pass rate, consistent formatting, reduced complexity, and improved test coverage**.

## 🔧 OPTIMIZED CLAUDE CODE TOOL INTEGRATION

**Tool Usage Strategy**: Leverage Claude Code tools strategically for maximum efficiency:

1. **Bash Tool**: Execute linters, formatters, complexity analyzers
   - Run language-specific linters (eslint, pylint, golint, etc.)
   - Execute formatters (prettier, black, gofmt, etc.)
   - Measure complexity metrics and coverage

2. **Grep Tool**: Search for quality patterns and anti-patterns
   - Find complex functions and duplicate code
   - Locate TODOs and technical debt markers
   - Search for security vulnerabilities and bad practices

3. **Read Tool**: Analyze code structure and patterns
   - Read source files to understand complexity
   - Examine test files for coverage gaps
   - Check configuration files for linting rules

4. **Edit/MultiEdit Tools**: Apply quality improvements efficiently
   - Use MultiEdit for consistent changes across files
   - Make precise refactoring changes
   - Preserve functionality while improving quality

## 📊 INTELLIGENT QUALITY CATEGORIZATION SYSTEM

**IMMEDIATELY** categorize quality issues into these priority levels:

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Fix First)
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- Build-breaking linting errors
- Critical performance anti-patterns
- Memory leaks and resource management issues

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Second)
- Code complexity violations (high cyclomatic complexity)
- Missing critical test coverage
- Significant code duplication
- Inconsistent error handling

### 🟢 STANDARD (Fix Third)
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Minor linting warnings
- Non-critical naming convention violations
- Documentation gaps

### 🔵 ENHANCEMENT (Fix Last)
- Code optimization opportunities
- Advanced pattern improvements
- Additional test scenarios
- Performance micro-optimizations

## ⚡ SYSTEMATIC WORKFLOW FOR OPTIMAL EFFICIENCY

**PARALLEL vs SEQUENTIAL Decision Matrix:**

**USE PARALLEL (5-Agent Spawning) when:**
- Multiple quality categories need attention
- Large codebase requiring comprehensive audit
- Mixed technology stack (multiple languages/frameworks)
- Time-critical quality gate before release
- Technical debt reduction initiative

**USE SEQUENTIAL (Single Agent) when:**
- Single quality issue type (e.g., just formatting)
- Small codebase or single module
- Quick pre-commit quality check
- Single language/framework context

---

### **SEQUENTIAL WORKFLOW** (Single Agent - Simple Scenarios)

**Phase 1: Rapid Assessment (2 minutes max)**
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks
npm run lint 2>&1 | tee lint_output.log
# OR: pylint **/*.py 2>&1 | tee lint_output.log
# OR: golangci-lint run ./... 2>&1 | tee lint_output.log
```

**Phase 2: Intelligent Analysis (5 minutes max)**
- Categorize issues by type and severity
- Identify patterns in quality violations
- Estimate fix complexity for each category
- Prioritize based on impact and effort

**Phase 3: Systematic Fixes (iterative)**
For each quality category:
1. **Apply targeted improvements** using Edit/MultiEdit tools
2. **Immediate verification** with linting tools
3. **Progress reporting** - state quality metrics improvement
4. **Move to next category** only after current category is resolved

**Phase 4: Final Validation (3 minutes max)**
- Run all quality checks to ensure compliance
- Generate before/after quality metrics
- Document improvements and recommendations

---

### **PARALLEL WORKFLOW** (5-Agent Coordination - Complex Scenarios)

**Phase 1: Multi-Agent Deployment (1 minute)**
- Spawn 5 specialized quality agents via Task tool
- Set coordination timestamp: `TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)`
- Initialize shared state files in `/tmp/quality-*-${TIMESTAMP}.json`

**Phase 2: Parallel Analysis & Implementation (5-15 minutes)**
- **Agent 1**: Quality analysis and categorization
- **Agent 2**: Style and formatting enforcement
- **Agent 3**: Complexity reduction and refactoring
- **Agent 4**: Test coverage improvement
- **Agent 5**: Validation and reporting

**Phase 3: Result Aggregation (2 minutes)**
- Collect results from all coordination files
- Verify all quality gates pass
- Consolidate improvements and metrics

**Phase 4: Final Verification (3 minutes)**
- Run complete quality suite
- Document improvements and metrics
- Generate actionable recommendations

## 🧠 FRAMEWORK-AWARE INTELLIGENCE

**Automatically detect and optimize for specific frameworks:**

### JavaScript/TypeScript (ESLint, Prettier)
- Common issues: inconsistent formatting, unused variables, complexity
- Look for: `.eslintrc`, `prettier.config`, `tsconfig.json`
- Fix patterns: Auto-fix with eslint --fix, prettier --write

### Python (Pylint, Black, isort)
- Common issues: PEP8 violations, import order, type hints
- Look for: `pylintrc`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`
- Fix patterns: black formatting, isort imports, add type hints

### Go (golangci-lint, gofmt)
- Common issues: inefficient code, error handling, formatting
- Look for: `.golangci.yml`, `go.mod`
- Fix patterns: gofmt -w, fix error handling patterns

### Java (Checkstyle, SpotBugs)
- Common issues: code style violations, potential bugs, complexity
- Look for: `checkstyle.xml`, `spotbugs.xml`
- Fix patterns: Apply Google/Sun style, reduce complexity

### PHP (PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPStan)
- Common issues: PSR violations, type safety, deprecated features
- Look for: `phpcs.xml`, `phpstan.neon`
- Fix patterns: phpcbf auto-fix, upgrade deprecated code

## 🚨 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

**For each quality issue, systematically determine:**

1. **What's the issue?** (specific violation or anti-pattern)
2. **Why does it matter?** (impact on maintainability, performance, security)
3. **What's the fix?** (minimal change to resolve)
4. **Will this fix break anything?** (impact on functionality)
5. **How to prevent recurrence?** (linting rules, git hooks)

## 📈 PROGRESS COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

**For SEQUENTIAL workflow, after every improvement iteration:**
- "Fixed [X] quality issues in [category]. Current metrics: [Y] issues remaining"
- "Quality score improved from [A]% to [B]%"
- "Next focus: [category] with [N] violations"

**For PARALLEL workflow, provide coordination updates:**
- "Spawned 5 quality agents for parallel enforcement. Timestamp: [TIMESTAMP]"
- "Agent progress: Analysis [done], Style [fixing], Complexity [reducing], Tests [improving], Validation [pending]"
- "Quality enforcement complete. Metrics: [X]% improvement across [N] files"

## 🛡️ QUALITY ASSURANCE GATES

**Before marking any quality improvement as "complete":**
- [ ] All linting errors resolved
- [ ] Formatting consistent across codebase
- [ ] Complexity metrics within thresholds
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements
- [ ] No functionality regressions
- [ ] Performance not degraded

## 🔄 INTELLIGENT PATTERN RECOGNITION

**Common patterns and immediate fixes:**

### Complexity Reduction
```javascript
// BROKEN: Deeply nested conditionals
if (a) {
  if (b) {
    if (c) {
      // logic
    }
  }
}

// FIXED: Early returns and extracted functions
if (!a) return;
if (!b) return;
if (!c) return;
// logic
```

### Code Duplication
```python
# BROKEN: Repeated code blocks
def process_a(data):
    validate(data)
    transform(data)
    save(data)

def process_b(data):
    validate(data)
    transform(data)
    save(data)

# FIXED: Extract common functionality
def process_common(data):
    validate(data)
    transform(data)
    save(data)
```

### Import Organization
```typescript
// BROKEN: Unorganized imports
import { z } from './utils';
import React from 'react';
import { a } from '../lib';
import path from 'path';

// FIXED: Organized by type
import path from 'path';
import React from 'react';
import { a } from '../lib';
import { z } from './utils';
```
