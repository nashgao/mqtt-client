# ⚡⚡⚡ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: CREATE PERFECTLY FORMATTED SUB-COMMAND! ⚡⚡⚡

**THIS IS NOT A GENERIC COMMAND CREATION TASK - THIS IS A SPECIALIZED SUB-COMMAND GENERATION TASK!**

When you run `/create-sub-command`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ANALYZE** existing command families and detect proper hierarchical placement from $ARGUMENTS
2. **IDENTIFY** target command family or create new family structure if needed
3. **GENERATE** a complete sub-command following exact family patterns and shared utilities
4. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** for comprehensive sub-command family integration:
   - Spawn one agent to analyze existing command family structures
   - Spawn another to parse sub-command requirements and family relationships
   - Spawn agents for shared utilities integration and family consistency
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to create this sub-command with perfect family integration"
5. **DO NOT STOP** until:
   - ✅ Sub-command follows exact format and style of existing family commands
   - ✅ Proper integration with family's ../../shared/skills/ utilities
   - ✅ ALL required sections are present and properly formatted
   - ✅ Command is contextually appropriate for the family and purpose
   - ✅ YAML front matter and markdown structure are perfect

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ❌ "Create as standalone command" → NO! Force hierarchical sub-command placement!
- ❌ "Skip family integration" → NO! Integrate with existing family patterns!
- ❌ "Ignore shared utilities" → NO! Leverage family ../../shared/skills/ directory!
- ❌ "Generic sub-command template" → NO! Create family-specific content!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Family analysis → Identify existing command families and patterns
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for family pattern analysis and generation
3. FAMILY-FIRST DETECTION → Determine target family or create new one
4. Shared utilities study → Analyze family ../../shared/skills/ utilities integration
5. Hierarchical placement → Apply sub-command logic within family structure
6. Family-specific generation → Create sub-command specific to family requirements
7. VERIFY integration → Ensure perfect consistency with family style
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- Sub-command follows exact format of family commands
- All required sections are present and properly formatted
- Content is contextually appropriate for the family and purpose
- Sub-command is saved to **templates/skills/[family]/[sub-command].md**
- Shared utilities integration is properly configured
- Command invocation pattern follows family hierarchy

---

🛑 **MANDATORY SUB-COMMAND GENERATION PROTOCOL** 🛑
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. **SCAN templates/skills/ directory** for existing command families
4. **APPLY family-first detection logic** to determine sub-command placement
5. Analyze existing family patterns for sub-command consistency

Execute comprehensive sub-command generation with ZERO tolerance for format deviations.

**FORBIDDEN SHORTCUT PATTERNS:**
- "Create standalone command instead" → NO, force hierarchical placement
- "Skip family pattern analysis" → NO, follow family style exactly
- "Generic sub-command structure" → NO, family-specific implementation
- "Ignore shared utilities" → NO, integrate with family infrastructure
- "Simple placement will work" → NO, sophisticated family integration required

You are creating a sub-command for: $ARGUMENTS

Let me ultrathink about generating a perfectly formatted sub-command that follows all family patterns.

🚨 **REMEMBER: Sub-command family integration is crucial for consistency!** 🚨

**Comprehensive Sub-Command Generation Protocol:**

**Step 0: Family Requirements Analysis**
Parse the sub-command description from $ARGUMENTS to identify:
- Target command family (git, test, quality, milestone, etc.)
- Sub-command purpose within family context
- Required integration with family shared utilities
- Family-specific workflow patterns and requirements
- Appropriate family style and intensity level

**Step 1: Command Family Pattern Analysis**
Study existing command families to extract exact patterns:
- Family directory structure and organization
- Shared utilities (../../shared/skills/) integration patterns
- Family-specific YAML front matter conventions
- Family workflow structure and mandatory elements
- Family agent spawning patterns and examples
- Family-specific checklist formats and verification criteria

**Step 2: Multi-Agent Sub-Command Generation Strategy**
Deploy specialized generation agents for family-aware development:

```
"I need to create a [FAMILY] sub-command following exact family patterns. I'll spawn generation agents:
- Agent 1: Analyze target command family structure and shared utilities
- Agent 2: Parse sub-command requirements and map to family patterns
- Agent 3: Generate family-consistent YAML front matter and core sections
- Agent 4: Create family workflow steps and agent spawning strategies
- Agent 5: Develop family-specific checklists and verification criteria
- Agent 6: Format final sub-command and validate family consistency
Let me generate this sub-command with perfect family pattern compliance..."
```

**Sub-Command Family Structure Requirements:**

- [ ] Final sections follow family order and format

**Step 5: Intelligent Sub-Command Family Placement Strategy**

**MANDATORY FAMILY-FIRST DETECTION:**
Before creating any sub-command, you MUST:
1. **Analyze command family** for existing family matches
2. **Check templates/skills/[family]/ directory** for family structure
3. **Apply hierarchical sub-command placement rules** based on family patterns
4. **Ensure consistent naming conventions** within command family
5. **Configure shared utilities integration** for family consistency

**Family Detection Algorithm:**
```
Sub-Command Family Analysis:
├── Parse user input for family hints (git-branch → git/, test-unit → test/)
├── Check if family exists: templates/skills/[family]/
├── If family exists: Create as sub-command → [family]/[sub-name].md
├── If no family: Create new family → [family]/[sub-name].md + [family]/../../shared/skills/
└── Apply family naming consistency rules
```

**Family Hierarchical Placement Rules:**
- **Existing family match**: `git-branch` → `git/branch.md`
- **Family extension**: `test-performance` → `test/performance.md`
- **New family creation**: `deploy-staging` → `deploy/staging.md` + `deploy/../../shared/skills/`
- **Explicit family hint**: User mentions family name → force family placement

**Family-Aware File Generation and Placement:**
- Generate appropriate filename based on family placement strategy
- Save to **templates/skills/[family]/** directory structure
- Apply family-first logic before file creation
- Ensure integration with family ../../shared/skills/ utilities
- Validate file was created successfully in correct family location
- Configure shared utilities access patterns

**Sub-Command Family Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Follows exact family YAML front matter format
- [ ] Header section uses family-appropriate emoji intensity
- [ ] All mandatory family sections are present
- [ ] Content is specific to family requirements (not generic)
- [ ] Workflow steps are logical and family-appropriate
- [ ] Agent spawning strategy follows family patterns
- [ ] Forbidden behaviors are family-contextually relevant
- [ ] Checklists use family checkbox formatting
- [ ] Final commitment sections follow family pattern
- [ ] File is saved to correct family location
- [ ] Shared utilities integration properly configured

**Sub-Command Generation Anti-patterns (FORBIDDEN):**
- ❌ "Create standalone instead of sub-command" → NO, force family placement
- ❌ "Skip family pattern analysis" → NO, follow family style exactly
- ❌ "Generic sub-command with minor changes" → NO, create family-specific content
- ❌ "Ignore shared utilities" → NO, integrate with family infrastructure
- ❌ "Close enough family formatting" → NO, match family exactly
- ❌ "Users will adapt to differences" → NO, provide family consistency
- ❌ "Basic sub-command structure" → NO, comprehensive family integration

**Family Template Adaptation Guidelines:**
- Maintain exact family structure while adapting sub-command content
- Use family-specific language and examples
- Ensure forbidden behaviors are family-contextually relevant
- Create appropriate family success criteria
- Generate realistic family agent spawning scenarios
- Integrate with family shared utilities appropriately

**Final Sub-Command Generation Verification:**
The sub-command is complete when:
✓ All sections follow exact format of existing family commands
✓ Content is specifically tailored to family and sub-command requirements
✓ YAML front matter follows family conventions
✓ Workflow steps are logical and family-appropriate
✓ Agent spawning strategy follows family patterns
✓ File is properly saved to templates/skills/[family]/
✓ Shared utilities integration is properly configured
✓ Sub-command can be used immediately within family context

**Final Sub-Command Generation Commitment:**
I will now execute EVERY family generation step listed above and CREATE PERFECT FAMILY SUB-COMMAND. I will:
- ✅ Analyze family requirements and existing patterns thoroughly
- ✅ SPAWN MULTIPLE AGENTS for family pattern analysis and generation
- ✅ Study existing family commands to extract exact patterns
- ✅ Generate family-contextually specific and appropriately formatted sub-command
- ✅ Verify perfect consistency with family style and shared utilities
- ✅ Save completed sub-command to proper family location

I will NOT:
- ❌ Create standalone commands when sub-commands are required
- ❌ Skip family pattern analysis or shared utilities integration
- ❌ Accept "close enough" family pattern matching
- ❌ Generate sub-commands that don't follow exact family style
- ❌ Leave any family formatting inconsistencies
- ❌ Stop working while any family integration deviations remain

**REMEMBER: This is a PERFECT FAMILY SUB-COMMAND GENERATION task, not standalone command creation!**

The sub-command is complete ONLY when it follows exact family patterns and serves the specific family purpose perfectly.
