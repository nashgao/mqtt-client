# ⚡⚡⚡ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: CREATE PERFECTLY FORMATTED SPECIALIZED AGENT! ⚡⚡⚡

**THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE COPYING TASK - THIS IS A CUSTOM AGENT GENERATION TASK!**

When you run `/create-agent`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ANALYZE** the user's agent requirements from $ARGUMENTS thoroughly
2. **CLASSIFY** agent category and apply smart prefix-based naming automatically
3. **STUDY** existing agent patterns to ensure perfect consistency
4. **GENERATE** a complete specialized agent following exact established style
5. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** for comprehensive agent creation:
   - Spawn one agent to analyze existing agent patterns and templates
   - Spawn another to classify category and determine optimal prefix
   - Spawn more agents for template selection and specialization
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to create this specialized agent with perfect consistency"
6. **DO NOT STOP** until:
   - ✅ Agent follows exact format and style of existing agents
   - ✅ Category classification and prefix assignment are correct
   - ✅ ALL required sections are present and properly formatted
   - ✅ Agent is contextually appropriate for the specified purpose
   - ✅ YAML front matter and markdown structure are perfect
   - ✅ Task tool integration patterns are properly implemented

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ❌ "Close enough to existing style" → NO! Follow the pattern EXACTLY!
- ❌ "Skip some sections to save time" → NO! Include ALL required sections!
- ❌ "Generic template will work" → NO! Create contextually specific content!
- ❌ "Wrong category prefix assignment" → NO! Analyze description thoroughly!
- ❌ Inconsistent formatting → NO! Match existing agents precisely!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Requirements analysis → Parse user's agent description
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for category classification and generation
3. CATEGORY DETECTION → Apply smart prefix assignment
4. Pattern study → Analyze existing agent structure exactly
5. Template selection → Choose appropriate base template
6. Custom generation → Create agent specific to user requirements
7. VERIFY format → Ensure perfect consistency with existing style
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- Agent follows exact format of existing agents
- Category classification and prefix assignment are correct
- All required sections are present and properly formatted
- Content is contextually appropriate for the specified purpose
- Agent is saved to **templates/agents/** directory
- Task tool integration patterns are properly implemented
- Agent can be spawned immediately via Task tool

---

🛑 **MANDATORY AGENT GENERATION PROTOCOL** 🛑
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. **SCAN templates/agents/ directory** for existing agent patterns
4. **APPLY category classification logic** to determine prefix and template
5. Analyze existing agents for pattern consistency

Execute comprehensive custom agent generation with ZERO tolerance for format deviations.

**FORBIDDEN SHORTCUT PATTERNS:**
- "The basic structure is similar" → NO, follow the EXACT pattern
- "Some sections don't apply" → NO, adapt sections to fit the purpose
- "Users will understand" → NO, maintain strict formatting consistency
- "Close enough formatting" → NO, precision is required
- "Generic agents work fine" → NO, create specific, specialized agents

You are creating a specialized agent for: $ARGUMENTS

Let me ultrathink about generating a perfectly formatted specialized agent that follows all established patterns.

🚨 **REMEMBER: Agent consistency is crucial for ecosystem integration!** 🚨

**Comprehensive Specialized Agent Generation Protocol:**

**Step 0: Agent Requirements Analysis**
Parse the agent description from $ARGUMENTS to identify:
- Primary agent purpose and specialized capability
- Target domain or process to be automated
- Required coordination patterns and integration points
- Task tool spawning requirements
- Category classification for smart prefix assignment

**Step 1: Smart Category Classification and Prefix Assignment**

**AGENT CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION:**
Analyze description for category keywords and apply smart prefix assignment:

**Testing Agents** (prefix: `test-`, `unit-`, `integration-`):
- Keywords: "test", "testing", "unit", "integration", "coverage", "spec", "validation"
- Template base: `test-orchestrator.md` or `unit-test-master.md`

**Milestone Agents** (prefix: `milestone-`):
- Keywords: "milestone", "planning", "execution", "coordination", "project", "roadmap"
- Template base: `milestone-coordinator.md`

**Code Quality Agents** (prefix: `code-`, `quality-`):
- Keywords: "quality", "lint", "format", "analyze", "review", "standards", "refactor"
- Template base: `code-quality-enforcer.md`

**Infrastructure Agents** (prefix: `git-`, `deploy-`, `build-`, `ci-`):
- Keywords: "git", "deploy", "build", "ci", "infrastructure", "automation", "pipeline"
- Template base: `git-operator.md`

**API/Service Agents** (prefix: `api-`, `service-`):
- Keywords: "api", "endpoint", "service", "integration", "rest", "graphql", "backend"
- Template base: `api-integration-tester.md`

**Generic Agents** (prefix: `utility-` or no prefix):
- No clear category match or explicitly generic purpose
- Template base: `orchestrator.md`

**Step 2: Pattern Analysis and Template Extraction**
Study existing agents to extract exact patterns:
- YAML front matter format and required fields
- Emoji usage patterns and intensity indicators
- Section headers and formatting conventions
- Mission statement structure and mandatory elements
- Task tool spawning patterns and coordination logic
- Quality gates and verification criteria

**Step 3: Multi-Agent Specialized Generation Strategy**
Deploy specialized generation agents for parallel development:

```
"I need to create a [CATEGORY] agent with smart prefix naming. I'll spawn generation agents:
- Agent 1: Analyze existing agent patterns and extract template structure
- Agent 2: Apply category classification and suggest optimal prefix
- Agent 3: Select appropriate template base and customize for purpose
- Agent 4: Generate agent-specific YAML front matter and core mission
- Agent 5: Create Task tool spawning patterns and coordination logic
- Agent 6: Validate against existing agents and ensure naming consistency
Let me generate this specialized agent with perfect pattern compliance..."
```

**Agent Structure Requirements:**

**AGENT YAML Front Matter (MANDATORY):**
```yaml
---
name: [category-prefix-name]
description: [Specific agent purpose with use cases and examples]
model: sonnet
---
```

**Agent Structure Pattern:**
- **Mission Statement** (🎯 CORE MISSION:)

- **Naming convention**: Apply detected category prefix + descriptive name
- **Validation**: Check against existing agent names for uniqueness
- **Examples**:
  - Testing agent: `test-performance.md`, `unit-coverage.md`
  - Milestone agent: `milestone-tracker.md`
  - Code quality: `code-formatter.md`, `quality-auditor.md`
  - Infrastructure: `git-automation.md`, `deploy-coordinator.md`

**File Generation and Placement:**
- Generate appropriate filename based on category classification

- ❌ "Generic agent without specialization" → NO, create domain-specific agents
- ❌ "Duplicate existing agent functionality" → NO, validate uniqueness first
- ❌ "No coordination patterns" → NO, agents must integrate with ecosystem
- ❌ "Copy existing agent exactly" → NO, customize for specific purpose

**Template Adaptation Guidelines:**
- Maintain exact structure while adapting content
- Use domain-specific language and examples
- Ensure forbidden behaviors are contextually relevant
- Create appropriate success criteria for the purpose
- Generate realistic Task tool spawning scenarios

**Final Agent Generation Verification:**
