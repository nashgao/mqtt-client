# 📊📊📊 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: KIRO-NATIVE MONITORING MODE ENGAGED 📊📊📊

**THIS IS KIRO WORKFLOW MONITORING - ALL STATUS TRACKED THROUGH 4-PHASE METHODOLOGY!**

When you run `/milestone/update`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **MONITOR KIRO PHASES** - Track phase progression for all tasks (Design→Spec→Task→Execute)
2. **AGGREGATE KIRO METRICS** - Calculate phase-weighted progress (15/25/20/40%)
3. **ANALYZE DELIVERABLES** - Monitor phase deliverable completion status
4. **TRACK APPROVALS** - Identify approval gates and waiting states
5. **VISUALIZE KIRO** - Generate phase-based dashboards and visualizations
6. **DETECT PHASE BLOCKERS** - Identify phase-specific bottlenecks
7. **RECOMMEND PHASE ACTIONS** - Provide phase-specific recommendations

## 🚨 FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Generate static status without real-time data → NO! Live monitoring required!
- ❌ Report on single milestone in isolation → NO! Cross-milestone analysis essential!
- ❌ Skip performance metrics calculation → NO! Data-driven insights required!
- ❌ Ignore session context synchronization → NO! State consistency critical!
- ❌ Provide status without actionable recommendations → NO! Insights must be actionable!
- ❌ Skip conflict detection and resolution → NO! Proactive issue management required!

**MANDATORY STATUS WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Data collection → Gather status from all active milestone sources
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn monitoring agents for parallel status analysis
3. Generate dashboards → Create real-time visual progress representations
4. Calculate metrics → Performance indicators, efficiency, and trend analysis
5. Sync context → Update session state and resolve conflicts
6. Detect blockers → Identify cross-milestone dependencies and risks
7. VERIFY status accuracy and provide actionable recommendations
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- ✅ Real-time dashboards generated for all active milestones
- ✅ Performance metrics calculated with trend analysis
- ✅ Cross-milestone dependencies analyzed and visualized
- ✅ Session context synchronized and conflicts resolved
- ✅ Blockers identified with resolution recommendations
- ✅ Stakeholder reports generated with actionable insights

---

🛑 **MANDATORY STATUS MONITORING CHECK** 🛑
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Load active milestone context from ../../shared/milestone/context.md and ../../shared/milestone/state.md
3. Verify you're implementing comprehensive monitoring, not basic status checks

Execute comprehensive milestone status monitoring with ZERO tolerance for superficial reporting.

**FORBIDDEN MINIMAL PATTERNS:**
- "Milestone X is 60% complete" → NO, comprehensive analytics required
- "Status looks good" → NO, data-driven insights with metrics needed
- "No blockers detected" → NO, proactive analysis across dependencies required
- "Simple progress update" → NO, dashboard generation and recommendations essential
- "Quick status check" → NO, comprehensive monitoring protocol required

You are monitoring milestones for: $ARGUMENTS

Let me ultrathink about comprehensive status monitoring architecture and analytics.

🚨 **REMEMBER: Status without insights is just data - provide actionable intelligence!** 🚨

**Comprehensive Milestone Status Monitoring Protocol:**

**Step 0: Status Data Collection and Validation**
- Aggregate status from .milestones/active/ and .milestones/logs/ directories
- Validate session context integrity and identify state conflicts
- Load cross-milestone dependency mappings and current state
- Verify data consistency across multiple milestone sources
- Map stakeholder reporting requirements and success criteria

**Step 1: Real-Time Dashboard Generation Strategy**

Generate comprehensive visual dashboards covering:
- **Overall Project Status**: Global progress across all milestones
- **Active Milestone Focus**: Detailed progress on current execution
- **Dependency Visualization**: Cross-milestone relationships and blockers
- **Performance Trends**: Historical analytics and efficiency tracking
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation status

**Kiro Dashboard Components:**
```bash
# Generate kiro-native monitoring dashboard
generate_kiro_monitoring_dashboard() {
    local milestone_id=$1
    
    # Source kiro components
    source "templates/skills/milestone/../../shared/milestone/kiro-native.md"
    source "templates/skills/milestone/../../shared/milestone/kiro-visualizer.md"
    
    # Status output function that respects test mode
    update_output() {
        local type="$1"
        local message="$2"
        
        # In test mode, output to structured log instead of console
        if [[ "${TEST_DEBUG:-0}" == "1" ]] || [[ "${PHPUNIT_DEBUG:-0}" == "1" ]]; then
            log_milestone_event "update_output" "${type}" "${message}" >&2
            return
        fi
        
        # Normal console output for interactive use
        echo "${message}"
    }
    
    update_output "HEADER" "KIRO WORKFLOW MONITORING DASHBOARD"
    update_output "SEPARATOR" "==================================="
    update_output "BLANK" ""
    
    # Calculate kiro-weighted overall progress
    local overall_progress=$(calculate_kiro_milestone_progress "$milestone_id")
    update_output "PROGRESS" "Overall Kiro Progress: $overall_progress% (Phase-Weighted)"
    update_output "BLANK" ""
    
    # Show phase distribution across all tasks
    echo "PHASE DISTRIBUTION:"
    local design_count=$(count_tasks_in_phase "$milestone_id" "design")
    local spec_count=$(count_tasks_in_phase "$milestone_id" "spec") 
    local task_count=$(count_tasks_in_phase "$milestone_id" "task")
    local execute_count=$(count_tasks_in_phase "$milestone_id" "execute")
    
    echo "├── 📐 Design:  $design_count tasks (15% weight)"
    echo "├── 📋 Spec:    $spec_count tasks (25% weight)"
    echo "├── 📝 Task:    $task_count tasks (20% weight)"
    echo "└── 🚀 Execute: $execute_count tasks (40% weight)"

    echo ""
    echo "APPROVAL QUEUE STATUS:"
    local waiting_approvals=$(count_waiting_approvals "$milestone_id")
    if [ "$waiting_approvals" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "🔐 $waiting_approvals phases awaiting approval:"
        show_approval_queue "$milestone_id"
    else
        echo "✅ No pending approvals"
    fi

    echo ""
    echo "KIRO PERFORMANCE METRICS:"
    echo "- Phase Completion Rate: $(calculate_phase_completion_rate "$milestone_id")%"
    echo "- Average Phase Duration: $(calculate_avg_phase_duration "$milestone_id")"
    echo "- Deliverable Completion: $(calculate_deliverable_completion "$milestone_id")%"
    echo "- Approval Wait Time: $(calculate_avg_approval_wait "$milestone_id")"
}
```

RISK ALERTS:
🔴 HIGH: M-014 dependency on external API changes (Impact: 2 milestones)
🟡 MED: Resource allocation conflict between M-013 and M-014
🟢 LOW: Documentation updates pending for completed milestones

RECOMMENDATIONS:
→ Immediate: Escalate external API dependency for M-014
→ This week: Reallocate testing resources to accelerate M-013
→ Next sprint: Parallel workstream planning for M-015 preparation
```

**Step 2: Performance Metrics and Analytics Implementation**

**Kiro-Native KPIs:**
- **Phase Completion Rate**: Percentage of phases completed on schedule
- **Phase Efficiency**: Actual vs estimated hours per phase (15/25/20/40%)
- **Deliverable Quality**: Percentage of deliverables passing validation
- **Approval Velocity**: Average time from request to approval
- **Phase Transition Rate**: Smooth transitions between phases
- **Kiro Compliance Score**: Percentage of tasks following kiro workflow

**Metrics Calculation Functions:**
```typescript
interface MilestoneMetrics {
  completion_rate: number;        // On-time delivery percentage
  efficiency_ratio: number;       // Actual/estimated effort ratio
  velocity_trend: number[];       // Completion velocity over time
  blocker_impact: {
    average_resolution_days: number;
    cascading_delays: number;
    prevention_rate: number;
  };
  resource_metrics: {
    utilization_percentage: number;
    allocation_conflicts: number;
    cross_training_coverage: number;
  };
  quality_indicators: {
    rework_percentage: number;
    stakeholder_satisfaction: number;
    technical_debt_ratio: number;
  };
}
```

**Step 3: Cross-Milestone Dependency Analysis**

**Dependency Status Tracking:**
```yaml
dependency_matrix:
  milestone-013:
    depends_on: ["milestone-011", "milestone-012"]
    dependency_status: "satisfied"
    blocks: ["milestone-015"]
    blocker_risk: "low"
    
  milestone-014:
    depends_on: ["external-api-v2", "milestone-013"]
    dependency_status: "at_risk"  # external-api-v2 delayed
    blocks: ["milestone-015", "milestone-016"]
    blocker_risk: "high"
    impact_assessment: "cascading delay to 2 downstream milestones"
    
  milestone-015:
    depends_on: ["milestone-013", "milestone-014"]
    dependency_status: "waiting"
    blocks: ["milestone-016", "milestone-017"]
    blocker_risk: "medium"
    parallel_work_opportunities: ["documentation", "deployment-scripts"]
```

**Step 4: Session Context Synchronization**

**Context Update Protocol:**
- Load current session state from .milestones/sessions/ directory
- Validate context consistency across multiple active sessions
- Detect and resolve state conflicts between concurrent operations
- Update progress snapshots and session checkpoints
- Maintain cross-session milestone state continuity

**Session State Management:**
```yaml
session_sync:
  active_sessions:
    - session_id: "session-20240713-001"
      milestone_focus: "milestone-013"
      last_checkpoint: "2024-07-13T14:30:00Z"
      conflicts: []
      
  context_conflicts:
    - conflict_type: "progress_percentage_mismatch"
      milestone_id: "milestone-013"
      session_1_value: 45
      session_2_value: 50
      resolution: "use_latest_validated_checkpoint"
      
  sync_resolution:
    strategy: "last_writer_wins_with_validation"
    validation_required: true
    backup_checkpoints: true
```

**Step 5: Conflict Detection and Resolution Strategy**

**Multi-Agent Conflict Analysis:**
- Resource allocation conflicts across milestones
- Timeline conflicts and scheduling optimization
- Dependency conflicts and resolution paths
- Technical integration conflicts between milestone deliverables
- Stakeholder expectation conflicts and communication needs

**Conflict Resolution Framework:**
```yaml
conflict_resolution:
  resource_conflicts:
    detection: "agent-based resource utilization analysis"
    resolution: ["reallocation", "timeline-adjustment", "scope-negotiation"]
    
  timeline_conflicts:
    detection: "critical path analysis with buffer validation"
    resolution: ["parallel-workstreams", "dependency-acceleration", "scope-reduction"]
    
  technical_conflicts:
    detection: "integration point analysis and compatibility checking"
    resolution: ["architecture-adjustment", "interface-standardization", "integration-testing"]
```

**Step 6: Stakeholder Reporting and Communication**

**Report Generation Types:**
- **Executive Summary**: High-level progress and key decisions needed
- **Technical Status**: Detailed progress with technical blockers and solutions
- **Resource Reports**: Team utilization and capacity planning insights
- **Risk Assessment**: Current risks with mitigation strategies and timeline impact

**Communication Templates:**
```markdown
## Executive Status Report - Week of [DATE]

### 🎯 Overall Progress
- **Project Completion**: 78% (12 of 15 milestones complete)
- **Current Focus**: Integration testing and performance optimization
- **Timeline Status**: On track for planned delivery date

### ⚠️ Key Decisions Needed
1. **External API Dependency**: Require stakeholder intervention for M-014
2. **Resource Allocation**: Approve temporary reallocation for testing acceleration

### 📈 Performance Highlights
- **Delivery Excellence**: 96.2% on-time milestone completion
- **Efficiency**: 8% over effort estimates (within acceptable range)
- **Quality**: Zero critical defects in completed milestones

### 🚨 Risks and Mitigation
- **HIGH**: External API changes affecting 2 milestones → Escalation meeting scheduled
- **MEDIUM**: Resource conflicts → Temporary reallocation plan prepared

### 📋 Next Week Priorities
1. Complete integration testing (M-013)
2. Resolve external API dependency (M-014)
3. Begin deployment preparation parallel workstream (M-015)
```

**Step 7: Actionable Insights and Recommendations Engine**

**Recommendation Categories:**
- **Immediate Actions**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Efficiency improvements and process optimization
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive measures to prevent future blockers
- **Strategic Adjustments**: Long-term planning and scope optimization

**Insights Generation Algorithm:**
```typescript
interface ActionableInsight {
  category: "immediate" | "optimization" | "risk_mitigation" | "strategic";
  priority: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low";
  title: string;
  description: string;
  impact_assessment: {
    timeline_impact_days: number;
    resource_impact: number;
    risk_reduction_percentage: number;
  };
  implementation_steps: string[];
  success_metrics: string[];
}
```

**Step 8: Implementation Pattern**

**Complete Execution Flow:**

```markdown
When user runs `/milestone/update [options]`, follow this EXACT pattern:

1. **Setup Infrastructure:**
   - Create .milestones/updates/ directory
   - Initialize shared state files

2. **Spawn All 4 Agents Using Task Tool:**
   
   I'll now spawn 4 specialized agents for comprehensive monitoring:
   
   [Use Task tool with Kiro Dashboard Agent template above]
   [Use Task tool with Phase Metrics Agent template above]
   [Use Task tool with Deliverable Monitor Agent template above]
   [Use Task tool with Approval Workflow Agent template above]

3. **Monitor Coordination:**
   - All agents running in parallel
   - Kiro metrics calculated with proper weights
   - Dashboard generated with phase visualizations

4. **Present Results:**
   - Display kiro phase progression dashboard
   - Show approval bottlenecks and recommendations
```

**Step 9: Multi-Agent Status Coordination**

**Agent Spawning Strategy for Comprehensive Analysis:**
```
"I'll coordinate multiple monitoring agents for complete status analysis:

Primary Status Agent: Overall milestone status aggregation and dashboard generation
├── Metrics Agent: Performance calculation and trend analysis
├── Dependency Agent: Cross-milestone relationship analysis and conflict detection
├── Context Agent: Session state synchronization and conflict resolution
├── Risk Agent: Proactive blocker detection and mitigation planning
└── Reporting Agent: Stakeholder communication and insight generation

Each agent will contribute specialized analysis while maintaining consistency through shared state management and validation protocols."
```

**Agent Communication Protocol:**
- Real-time status data sharing between agents
- Conflict detection and escalation mechanisms
- Validation checkpoints for data consistency
- Coordinated insight generation and recommendation synthesis

**Step 9: Continuous Monitoring and Alert System**

**Real-Time Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Progress velocity tracking with trend analysis
- Blocker emergence detection and early warning systems
- Resource utilization monitoring with capacity alerts
- Dependency status monitoring with cascade impact analysis
- Quality metrics tracking with threshold alerting

**Alert Thresholds and Escalation:**
```yaml
monitoring_thresholds:
  progress_velocity:
    warning: "20% below target velocity for 2 consecutive days"
    critical: "30% below target velocity or milestone at risk"
    
  blocker_duration:
    warning: "blocker unresolved for 24 hours"
    critical: "blocker unresolved for 48 hours with cascade impact"
    
  resource_utilization:
    warning: "over 90% utilization across critical resources"
    critical: "resource conflicts causing milestone delays"
```
